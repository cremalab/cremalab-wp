          <p>Our development team has serious technical chops. But what’s most important is that our technical team gets involved during the earliest stages of product development to advise on core features of the new product.</p>
          <p>Our team understands the context of every technical decision made over the course of Discovery before we start building. With regular team meetings and a collaborative development process, our team will craft and deliver an incredible product you can be proud of.</p>
