      <h2>Endurance Lending Network</h2>
      <p><a href="https://enduranceln.com">Endurance Lending Network (ELN)</a> has been one of our longest acting clients.  We were approached by their team in early 2012 to help them define and build a product that would help solve lending problems for small businesses and franchise owners.  In collaboration with their team, we were able to build a platform that 1) Allows franchise owners to quickly apply for loans, and 2) Enables ELN to efficiently process and underwrite loans in record time.  ELN recently had a successful merger with Funding Circle, an online marketplace that connects small businesses looking for loans with investors.  We are proud to have played a small part in such an important milestone in the life of their company!</p>

      <p>We worked with <a href="http://livebluekc.bluekc.com/">Blue KC</a> to concept out, design, and build an iOS application that allows you to discover health and wellness locations in the Kansas City area. Through sketching, wireframing, user experience, user interface design, and full development, we brought to life an application that makes living a healthier lifestyle that much more accessible.</p>

      <p><a href="http://startupweekend.org">Startup Weekend</a> is one the of the greatest entrepreneurial movements happening around the globe.  We worked hand-in-hand with the SW team to design a solution to easily launch and manage new city sites world wide, putting the power of these sites in the hands of the local organizers.

      <h2>Big Kansas City 2013</h2>
      <p>When <a href="http://www.siliconprairienews.com/locations/kansas-city">Silicon Prairie News</a> approached us with the opportunity to partner with them for the design and branding of Big Kansas City, we couldn't have been more thrilled. With it being the inaugural event, we really wanted to pay homage to the entrepreneurial roots and rich cultural history of Kansas City, while adding a modern tech flair. Through brand design and web design, tshirts, stickers, photo booth props, and assorted signage for the conference, we created an identity for Big Kansas City that accomplished our goal: celebrating our heritage, while anticipating a future bright with innovation.</p>

      <h2>KC Reverse Pitch</h2>
      <p>Global Entrepreneur Week is one of our favorite weeks, so when KC Next approached us to design and develop an application for KC Reverse Pitch, we were excited for the opportunity.</p>

      <p>We took a week to test out a rapid prototyping methodology to create a web application that allowed local entrepreneurs to respond to a list of problems that enterprise level companies needed solved.</p>

      <p>The summary and call-to-action of each problem were unveiled on the site in real-time as each company pitched their problem. It was an incredible feeling to be present at the event, and watch a room full of people following along with the presentations on their phones.</p>
